# Yelp Roulette
### Info 498 Final Project
As the name implies, this application will give you a restaurant at random based on your location.
The way it works is by grabbing your device's location and then connecting to the Yelp API to grab a list of restaurants. It will then randomly choose a restaurant and display it.
If you want, you can accumulate a list of favorites and then have the app choose from those instead of just a random restaurant.

If you want to try it on your device, here is an apk you can easily install: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24251075/YelpRoulette.apk

This was created by Sean Ker, Thomas Tseng, and Jeff Zhong for their Android Development final project at the UW Information School.
